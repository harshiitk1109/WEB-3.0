This code is a simple implementation of a function named "multiply" that takes two integer arguments "a" and "b" and returns the product of these two integers. The function is defined using the "int" return type and takes two "int" parameters, as declared in the function signature.Inside the function, the two integer parameters are multiplied using the "*" operator, and the result is stored in a variable named "result" of type "int". The result is then returned by the function using the "return" statement.In the main function, two integer variables named "x" and "y" are declared and initialized to 10 and 20, respectively. The "multiply" function is then called with these two integer values as arguments, and the result is stored in a new integer variable "z". Finally, the value of "z" is printed to the console using the printf() function.When the program is run, it will output the result of multiplying 10 and 20, which is 200.
